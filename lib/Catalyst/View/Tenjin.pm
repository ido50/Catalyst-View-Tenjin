	# check your new view's configuration
	__PACKAGE__->config(
		USE_STRICT => 1, # false by default
		INCLUDE_PATH => [ MyApp->path_to('root', 'templates') ],
		TEMPLATE_EXTENSION => '.html',
		ENCODING => 'UTF-8', # this is the default
	);
	 
	# render view from lib/MyApp.pm or lib/MyApp::C::SomeController.pm

		$c->stash->{template} = 'message.html';
		$c->stash->{message}  = 'Hello World!';
		$c->forward('MyApp::View::Tenjin');
	}

	# access variables from template

	The message is: [== $message =].

	# example when CATALYST_VAR is set to 'Catalyst'
	Context is [== $Catalyst =]          
	The base is [== $Catalyst->req->base =]

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This is the Catalyst view class for the L<Tenjin> template engine.

Your application should define a view class which is a subclass of
this module. There is no helper script to create this class automatically,
but you can do so easily as described in the synopsis.

Once you've created the view class, you can modify your action handlers
in the main application and/or controllers to forward to your view class.
You might choose to do this in the end() method, for example,
to automatically forward all actions to the Tenjin view class.

	# In MyApp or MyApp::Controller::SomeController

	sub end : Private {
		my( $self, $c ) = @_;
		$c->forward('MyApp::View::Tenjin');
	}

This module is now L<Moose>-based, so you can use method modifiers. For
example, you can perform some operation after or before this module begins
processing the request or rendering the template.

=head1 METHODS

=head2 COMPONENT( $c, $arguments )

This method is automatically called by Catalyst when creating the view.
The method creates an instance of Tenjin using the configuration options
set in the view.

=cut

sub COMPONENT {
	my ($class, $c, $arguments) = @_;

	my $config = {
		TEMPLATE_EXTENSION => '',
		%{ $class->config },
		%{$arguments},
	};

	unless (ref $config->{INCLUDE_PATH} eq 'ARRAY') {
		$config->{INCLUDE_PATH} = [_coerce_paths($config->{INCLUDE_PATH}, $config->{DELIMITER})];
		unless (scalar @{$config->{INCLUDE_PATH}}) {
			my $base = Path::Class::dir($c->config->{root}, 'base');
			$config->{INCLUDE_PATH} = [$c->config->{root}, $base];
		}
	}

	$c->log->debug("Tenjin Config: ".dump($config))
		if $c->debug && $config->{DUMP_CONFIG};

	my $self = $class->new($c, $config);
	
	$self->config($config);

	$Tenjin::USE_STRICT = 1
		if $config->{USE_STRICT};

	$Tenjin::ENCODING = $config->{ENCODING}
		if $config->{ENCODING};
	
	$self->{template} = Tenjin->new({
		path => $config->{INCLUDE_PATH},
		postfix => $config->{TEMPLATE_EXTENSION},
	});

	return $self;
};

=head2 process()

Renders the template specified in C<< $c->stash->{template} >> or
C<< $c->action >> (the private name of the matched action, with the default extension
specified by the C<TEMPLATE_EXTENSION> configuration item. Calls L<render> to
perform actual rendering. Output is stored in C<< $c->response->body >>.

=cut

sub process {
	my ($self, $c) = @_;

	my $template = $c->stash->{template} || $c->action . $self->config->{TEMPLATE_EXTENSION};

	unless (defined $template) {
		$c->log->debug('No template specified for rendering') if $c->debug;
		return 0;
	}

	my $output = $self->render($c, $template);

	$c->response->content_type('text/html; charset=utf-8')
		unless $c->response->content_type;

	$c->response->body($output);

	return 1;
}

=head2 check_tmpl( $template_name )

Checks if a template named C<$template_name> was already registered with
the view. Returns 1 if yes, C<undef> if no.

=cut

sub check_tmpl {
	my ($self, $name) = @_;

	return exists $self->{template}->{templates}->{$name} ? 1 : undef;
}

=head2 register( $tmpl_name, $tmpl_content )

Registers a template with the view from an arbitrary source, for immediate
usage in the application. C<$tmpl_name> is the name of the template, used
to distinguish it from others. C<$tmpl_content> is the body of the template.
Templates are registered in memory, so don't expect them to remain registered
between application restarts.

=cut

sub register {
	my ($self, $tmpl_name, $tmpl_content) = @_;

	my $template = Tenjin::Template->new(undef, $tmpl_name, $self->{template}->{init_opts_for_template});
	$template->convert($tmpl_content);
	$template->compile();

	$self->{template}->register_template($tmpl_name, $template);
}

=head2 render( $c, $template, \%args )

Renders the given template and returns output, or throws an exception
if an error was encountered.

C<$template> is the name of the template you wish to render. If this template
was not registered with the view yet, it will be searched for in the directories
set in the C<INCLUDE_PATH> configuration item.

The template variables are set to C<%$args> if $args is a hashref, or 
C<< %{$c->stash} >> otherwise. In either case the variables are augmented with 
C<$base> set to C<< $c->req->base >>, C<$name> to
C<< $c->config->{name} >> and the Catalyst context, which will be set to C<$c>
unless the C<CATALYST_VAR> configuration item is set to a different name. If so,
the C<$c>, C<$base> and C<$name> variables are omitted.

=cut

sub render {
	my ($self, $c, $tmpl_name, $args) = @_;

	$c->log->debug("Rendering template \"$tmpl_name\"")
		if $c->debug;

	my $vars = {
		(ref $args eq 'HASH' ? %$args : %{ $c->stash() }),
		$self->template_vars($c)
	};

	local $self->{include_path} = 
		[ @{ $vars->{additional_template_paths} }, @{ $self->{include_path} } ]
		if ref $vars->{additional_template_paths};

	return $self->{template}->render($tmpl_name, $vars);
}

=head2 template_vars( $c )

Returns a list of key-value pairs to be used as the context variables
(i.e. the context object) in the Tenjin templates.

=cut

sub template_vars {
	my ($self, $c) = @_;

	my $cvar = $self->config->{CATALYST_VAR};

	defined $cvar
		? ( $cvar => $c )
		: (
			c    => $c,
			base => $c->req->base,
			name => $c->config->{name}
		);
}

=head2 _coerce_paths( $dlim )

=cut

sub _coerce_paths {
	my ($paths, $dlim) = shift;
	return () unless $paths;
	return @{$paths} if ref $paths eq 'ARRAY';

	# tweak delim to ignore C:/
	unless (defined $dlim) {
		$dlim = ( $^O eq 'MSWin32' ) ? ':(?!\\/)' : ':';
	}

	return split( /$dlim/, $paths );
}

__PACKAGE__->meta->make_immutable;

=head2 CONFIGURATION

To configure your view class, you can call the C<config()> method
in the view subclass. This happens when the module is first loaded.

	package MyApp::View::Tenjin;

	use strict;
	use base 'Catalyst::View::Tenjin';

	__PACKAGE__->config(
		USE_STRICT => 1,
		INCLUDE_PATH => [ MyApp->path_to('root', 'templates') ],
		TEMPLATE_EXTENSION => '.html',
		ENCODING => 'utf8',
	);
 
You can also define a class item in your main application configuration,
again by calling the uniquitous C<config()> method. The items in the class
hash are added to those already defined by the above two methods. This
happens in the base class new() method (which is one reason why you must
remember to call it via C<MRO::Compat> if you redefine the C<new()> 
method in a subclass).

	package MyApp;

	use strict;
	use Catalyst;

	MyApp->config({
		name     => 'MyApp',
		root     => MyApp->path_to('root'),
		'View::Tenjin' => {
			USE_STRICT => 1,
			INCLUDE_PATH => [ MyApp->path_to('root', 'templates') ],
			TEMPLATE_EXTENSION => '.html',
			ENCODING => 'utf8',
		},
	});

The C<USE_STRICT> configuration option determines if Tenjin will C<use strict>
when evaluating the embedded Perl code inside your templates. If C<USE_STRICT>
is set to a true value (1), L<strict> will be used. This is recommended, but if
you're having trouble using C<strict>, you can set it to 0, or just not set it at
all (by default, Tenjin will not C<use strict> on embedded Perl code).

The C<ENCODING> configuration option tells Tenjin that how your template files are
encoded. By default, Tenjin will try to decode your templates as utf8.

If you set C<TEMPLATE_EXTENSION>, this extension will be automatically appended
to C<<$c->stash->{template}>> before being searched in the C<INCLUDE_PATH>.

=head2 DYNAMIC INCLUDE_PATH

Sometimes it is desirable to modify INCLUDE_PATH for your templates at run time.
 
Additional paths can be added to the start of INCLUDE_PATH via the stash as
follows:

	$c->stash->{additional_template_paths} =
		[$c->config->{root} . '/test_include_path'];

If you need to add paths to the end of INCLUDE_PATH, there is also an
include_path() accessor available:

	push( @{ $c->view('Tenjin')->include_path }, qw/path/ );

Note that if you use include_path() to add extra paths to INCLUDE_PATH, you
MUST check for duplicate paths. Without such checking, the above code will add
"path" to INCLUDE_PATH at every request, causing a memory leak.

A safer approach is to use include_path() to overwrite the array of paths
rather than adding to it. This eliminates both the need to perform duplicate
checking and the chance of a memory leak:

	@{ $c->view('Tenjin')->include_path } = qw/path another_path/;

If you are calling C<render> directly then you can specify dynamic paths by 
having a C<additional_template_paths> key with a value of additonal directories
to search. See L<CAPTURING TEMPLATE OUTPUT> for an example showing this.

=head2 RENDERING VIEWS

The view plugin renders the template specified in the C<template>
item in the stash.  

	sub message : Global {
		my ($self, $c) = @_;

		$c->stash->{template} = 'message.html';
		$c->forward('MyApp::View::Tenjin');
	}

If a stash item isn't defined, then it instead uses the
stringification of the action dispatched to (as defined by $c->action)
in the above example, this would be C<message>, but because the default
is to append '.html', it would load C<root/message.html>.

The items defined in the stash are passed to Tenjin for use as
template variables.

	sub default : Private {
		my ($self, $c) = @_;

		$c->stash->{template} = 'message.html';
		$c->stash->{message}  = 'Hello World!';
		$c->forward('MyApp::View::Tenjin');
	}

A number of other template variables are also added:

	$c      A reference to the context object, $c
	$base   The URL base, from $c->req->base()
	$name   The application name, from $c->config->{name}

These can be accessed from the template in the usual way:

	# message.html
	The message is: [== $message =]
	The base is [== $base =]
	The name is [== $name =]

The output generated by the template is stored in C<< $c->response->body >>.

=head3 MANUALLY PROVIDING TEMPLATES

Catalyst::View::Tenjin adds an easy method for providing your own templates,
such that you do not have to use template files stored on the file system.
For example, you can use templates stored on a DBIx::Class schema. This is
similar to L<Template Toolkit|Template>'s provider modules, which for some
reason I never managed to get working. You can register templates with
your application, and use them on the fly. For example:

	# check if the template was already registered
	unless ($c->view('Tenjin')->check_tmpl($template_name)) {
		# Load the template
		my $tmpl = $c->model('DB::Templates')->find($template_name);
		$c->view('Tenjin')->register($template_name, $tmpl->content);
	}

=head2 CAPTURING TEMPLATE OUTPUT

If you wish to use the output of a template for some other purpose than
displaying in the response, you can use the L<render> method. For example,
use can use it with L<Catalyst::Plugin::Email>:

	sub send_email : Local {
		my ($self, $c) = @_;

		$c->email(
			header => [
				To      => 'me@localhost',
				Subject => 'A TT Email',
			],
			body => $c->view('Tenjin')->render($c, 'email.html', {
				additional_template_paths => [ $c->config->{root} . '/email_templates'],
				email_tmpl_param1 => 'foo'
			}),
		);
		# Redirect or display a message
	}
